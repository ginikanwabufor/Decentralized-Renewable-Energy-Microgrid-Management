# Decentralized Renewable Energy Microgrid Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for managing decentralized renewable energy microgrids at the community level. The system uses smart contracts to coordinate energy production, consumption, payments, and maintenance in a transparent and efficient manner.

## Core Components

### Generator Registration Contract
Records and verifies all energy production sources within the microgrid, including solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable generators. This contract maintains ownership records, capacity ratings, and production history.

### Consumption Metering Contract
Tracks real-time energy usage by community members, providing accurate accounting of consumption patterns and load distribution across the microgrid.

### Payment Processing Contract
Handles automated billing and collection for energy usage, ensuring fair compensation to producers and transparent pricing for consumers based on actual usage.

### Maintenance Fund Contract
Manages shared costs for system upkeep, including equipment repairs, upgrades, and infrastructure maintenance. This contract governs how funds are collected, allocated, and disbursed.

## Key Features

- **Peer-to-peer energy trading**: Direct producer-to-consumer transactions without intermediaries
- **Transparent pricing**: Real-time visibility into energy costs and production credits
- **Decentralized governance**: Community-based decision making for system management
- **Automated settlements**: Smart contract-based payment reconciliation
- **Resilient infrastructure**: Fault-tolerant design for continuous operation
